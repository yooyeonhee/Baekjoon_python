Write a program which:

reads information about available seats in the plane,
calculates the sum of all seats available in that plane,
writes the result.
입력
In the first and only line of the standard input there are four integers n1, k1, n2 and k2 (1 ≤ n1, k1, n2, k2 ≤ 1 000), separated by single spaces.

출력
The first and only line of the standard output should contain one integer - the total number of seats available in the plane.
